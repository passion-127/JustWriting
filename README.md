### Introduction

[**Justwriting**](https://github.com/hjue/JustWriting) is a simple blog platform. You just need the text written in Markdown, upload the .md file to website, and it will show .md files as posts on your website. 

It can synchronize files to the server by Dropbox, so you don't have to care about losing your files when the server breaks, as all files can be stored on your local devices.

If you share the folder in Dropbox with others, all members can add or edit posts.

Of course, if you have problems to install Dropbox on servers, it also can upload files by FTP, SVN or git, or any other methods you can upload files with.

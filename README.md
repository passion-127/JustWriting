### Introduction

[**Justwriting**](https://github.com/hjue/JustWriting) is a simple blog platform. You just need writing content with Markdown format, upload the .md file to website, then it will show .md files as posts on your website. 

It can synchronize files to the server by Dropbox.

So don't care about lost files while the server damaged, as all files can be store on your local devices.

If share the folder in Dropbox with others, then all members can add, edit the postes.

Of cause, if you have problem to install Dropbox on servers, it also can upload files by FTP, SVN or git, any methods you can.
